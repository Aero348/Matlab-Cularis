  "The Pegasus engine data plates were fixed on the port side panel
  below the fore and aft level. The information on the plates read:
  Take off 2475 rpm. maximum +4 1/4 lb. sq. in.
           Maximum rpm   Boost.   Cylinder temp.   Oil temp.deg.C.
  Take off     2475      +4 1/4   235 for 15 min.      ??
  Climbing     2250      +2 1/2   235                  80
  Cruising     2250      +2       190                  70

  Oil pressure maximum 80 lb./sq. in. 5 minutes
               minimum 5 lb./sq. in."

  "The Pegasus XC was a 28.7 litre, civil-rated, medium
  supercharged, poppet-valved engine and equipped the S.23, S.33
  'boats and one of the S.30 aircraft - KZ CATHAY. The Bristol
  Perseus XIIC was 24.9 litre, civil rated, medium supercharged,
  sleeve-valve engine and was fitted to the eight S.30 'boats. Both
  types of engine were geared down to turn the airscrew at half
  crankshaft speed, through Farman type reduction gearing."
  (pp.91) 

  "The engines originally fitted to all the Mark I S.23 'boats, one
  of the S.30s and both the S.33 'boats were poppet valved Bristol
  Pegasus XCs. The engines developed 820/900 bhp. (589/611 kW.) at
  2250 rev. per min., at the rated altitude of 3500 ft. At sea
  level, the maximum power was 885/920 bhp.  (660/686 kW.) at 2250
  rev. per min. The maximum economy cruise power was 510 bhp. (380
  kW.).  The maximum engine speed for for the climb - with the
  airscrews in COARSE pitch - was 2250 rev.  per min. with +1 1/4
  lb. sq. in.. For continuous cruising the speed was 2500 rev. per
  min. up to 5000 ft. and 2100 rev. per min. over 5000
  ft. Maximum engine speed - all out - was 2600 rev. per min. with
  +2 1/2 lb. sq. in. for 5 minutes in level flight."
