/** FGFS / JSBSim interface (aka "The Bus").
    This class provides for an interface between FlightGear and its data
    structures and JSBSim and its data structures. This is the class which is
    used to command JSBSim when integrated with FlightGear. See the
    documentation for main for direction on running JSBSim apart from FlightGear.
