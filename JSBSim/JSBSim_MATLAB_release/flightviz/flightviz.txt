Flight Visualization

Phantom euler angles graphics


Creates an up-dateable display of an F4 Phantom jet with flight data.



I created this function to assist in displaying flight test data.

It creates a patch and a collection of hg transform objects which allow one to easily update the figure.

Also allows the control surfaces to be moved.

Bar meters are included to display altitude, Mach number and g's.

Typically one would use this inside a loop to display flight data as an animation. Just remember to call drawnow to force each frame to update.
